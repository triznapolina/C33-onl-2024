    //Task 1. Create a class with a static method. This method accepts three
    //parameters as input: login, password, and confirmPassword. WrongPasswordException and WrongLoginException are
    //custom exception classes with two constructors â€“ one by default,
    //the second accepts the exception message and passes it to the constructor of the Exception class.
    //Implement the user's login to the system, taking into account the fact that these fields are of the
    // String data type. Login must be less than 20 characters long and must not contain spaces. If login does not
    //meet these requirements, you must throw a WrongLoginException.
    //The password must be less than 20 characters long, must not contain spaces, and must
    //contain at least one digit. Also, password and confirmPassword must be equal.
    //If the password does not meet these requirements, you must discard it.
